Definition and Usage
The min-width property defines the minimum width of an element.

If the content is smaller than the minimum width, the minimum width will be applied.

If the content is larger than the minimum width, the min-width property has no effect.

Note: This prevents the value of the width property from becoming smaller than min-width.




.div{
  min-width:300px;
   width:500px
}



.div{
  min-width:300px;
   width:100px
}



---------------------------------------------------------------
The min-width property in CSS defines the minimum width that an element can have. It ensures that the element will be at least the specified width,
even if the content within it is smaller.

Lets examine the provided code examples:

Example 1:
.div {
  min-width: 300px;
  width: 500px;
}
In this example, the .div element has a min-width of 300px and a width of 500px. Since the width property is larger than the min-width, 
the min-width property does not come into effect. The element will have a width of 500px.

Example 2:

.div {
  min-width: 300px;
  width: 100px;
}
In this example, the .div element has a min-width of 300px and a width of 100px. Since the width property is smaller than the min-width, 
the min-width property becomes relevant. The elements width will be set to the min-width value of 300px, ensuring that it is at least that wide.

In both cases, the min-width property ensures that the elements width does not shrink below the specified value.
It acts as a constraint, preventing the width from becoming smaller than the defined minimum. 
This is particularly useful in responsive design to ensure that elements maintain a certain width even when the content is minimal or the viewport size is reduced.

Its important to note that if the content within the element exceeds the min-width, the elements width will expand to accommodate the content. 
The min-width property only establishes a minimum limit, and the elements width can grow beyond that limit if needed.

Overall, the min-width property is used to control the minimum width of elements, providing stability and preventing them from becoming
too narrow or shrinking beyond a certain point.
