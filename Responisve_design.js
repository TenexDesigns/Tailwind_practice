To make your code responsive for mobile and larger screens, you can apply the following adjustments:

Responsive Breakpoints: Tailwind CSS provides responsive utility classes that allow you to apply different styles based on screen sizes.
  You can use these classes to adjust the layout and spacing of your components for different screen sizes.

Hide/Show Items: You can selectively hide or show certain items based on screen sizes using the hidden and block classes.
  This can help you control the visibility of certain elements on smaller screens while displaying them on larger screens.

Image Sizes: To make your images responsive, you can use the w-full class on the Image component. 
  This allows the image to automatically adjust its width to fit the containers size.

Icon Sizes: Tailwind CSS provides various classes for adjusting the size of icons. 
  You can use classes like w-[size] and h-[size] to control the width and height of icons. 
  For example, w-6 and h-6 set the width and height of an icon to 6 units.

Spacing: Tailwind CSS has a wide range of spacing utility classes to control margins and paddings.
  You can use these classes to adjust the spacing between elements based on different screen sizes.

Here are some specific modifications you can make for responsiveness in your code:

Navbar.js: Apply responsive breakpoints, such as sm:hidden and lg:flex, to control the visibility of certain elements on smaller and larger screens.

Search.js: Use responsive classes like w-full to ensure that the search input expands to fill the available space on different screen sizes.

Chips.js: Adjust the size and spacing of the category chips using Tailwind CSS classes such as text-[size], py-[size], px-[size], and m-[size].

Banner.js and book.js: Apply responsive classes to adjust the positioning, font sizes, and spacing of the text elements and button based on different screen sizes.

By combining these modifications and using Tailwind CSSs responsive utility classes,
  you can create a responsive design that adapts well to various screen sizes, including mobile and larger screens.
