Semantic HTML elements are those which clearly describe their meaning to both the browser and the developer. They provide meaning to the web content and make web pages more accessible.

The main reasons to use semantic HTML elements are:

Readability: It makes the code easier to read and understand.
Accessibility: Screen readers can easily navigate through a semantic structure.
SEO: Better semantics means better SEO, as search engines use these elements to index the web content.
When creating new sections or content for your website, consider if there is a semantic element that fits the purpose of the content. While it is possible to use divs for everything, using semantic elements when appropriate can improve readability and accessibility.

Here are a few examples of semantic HTML elements:

<h1> to <h6>: Denote six levels of section headings. <h1> is the highest section level and <h6> is the lowest.
<nav>: Defines a set of navigation links.
<main>: Specifies the main content of a document.
<footer>: Specifies a footer for a document or section.
<article>: Specifies independent, self-contained content.
<section>: Defines sections in a document.

  Using semantic HTML elements over <div> elements is beneficial for creating more accessible, maintainable, and SEO-friendly web pages. Semantic HTML elements carry meaning and provide better context to both developers and assistive technologies (e.g., screen readers). Here are some reasons why and when to use semantic HTML elements over <div> elements:

Accessibility: Semantic elements help improve web accessibility by providing clear and meaningful information about the page's structure to screen readers and other assistive technologies. This ensures that all users, including those with disabilities, can navigate and understand the content more easily.

SEO (Search Engine Optimization): Search engines rely on semantic HTML elements to understand the content and structure of web pages. Using semantic elements can potentially improve your website's ranking in search engine results, as it allows search engines to better interpret the content and context.

Readability and Maintainability: Semantic elements make the code more readable and self-descriptive. When developers use semantic elements like <header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, and others, it becomes easier for them and other team members to understand the page's structure and purpose.

Structure and Meaning: Semantic elements express the meaning and structure of content, making it easier to interpret and maintain. For example, using <article> for a blog post or news article, or <aside> for a sidebar section, clearly conveys their roles in the overall page.

Future Compatibility: As web standards evolve, using semantic HTML elements ensures that your website is better prepared for future developments and improvements in web technologies.

When to use semantic HTML elements:

Page Structure: Use semantic elements to represent the primary structure of your page, such as <header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, <article>, <aside>, and <footer>.

Content Elements: For content with specific meanings, use semantic elements like <h1> to <h6> for headings, <p> for paragraphs, <ul> and <ol> for lists, <blockquote> for quotations, etc.

Media Elements: Use <img> for images, <video> for videos, and <audio> for audio content.

Form Elements: For forms, use semantic elements such as <form>, <input>, <label>, <textarea>, etc.

When to use <div> elements:

Layout and Styling: <div> elements are often used for layout and styling purposes, as they are generic container elements with no inherent meaning.

When No Suitable Semantic Element Exists: In some cases, there may not be a perfect semantic element to represent a particular section or structure. In such cases, <div> elements can be used.

In conclusion, prefer using semantic HTML elements whenever possible to provide meaningful structure, improve accessibility, and enhance the overall quality and maintainability of your web pages. 
                                            Use <div> elements primarily for layout and styling purposes when there's no suitable semantic element available.
