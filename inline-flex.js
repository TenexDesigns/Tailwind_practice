In Tailwind CSS, the inline-flex class is used to create a flex container with an inline-level display. It allows the container to take up only as much width as its contents require, rather than taking up the full width of its parent container.

In the context of the above example, the inline-flex class is applied to the outer div of the CategoryChip component. This ensures that the chips are displayed inline with each other horizontally, rather than stacking vertically. By default, div elements have a block-level display, which causes them to take up the full width available. By using inline-flex, the chips will only take up the necessary width based on their content.

Here's an example to illustrate the difference between flex and inline-flex:

jsx
Copy code
<div className="flex">
  <div className="w-32 h-10 bg-blue-500"></div>
  <div className="w-32 h-10 bg-red-500"></div>
  <div className="w-32 h-10 bg-green-500"></div>
</div>

<div className="inline-flex">
  <div className="w-32 h-10 bg-blue-500"></div>
  <div className="w-32 h-10 bg-red-500"></div>
  <div className="w-32 h-10 bg-green-500"></div>
</div>
In the first example with flex, the three inner divs will be displayed horizontally and take up the full width of their parent container. Each div has a width of 32 pixels (w-32) and a height of 10 pixels (h-10).

In the second example with inline-flex, the three inner divs will also be displayed horizontally, but they will only take up the necessary width based on their content. The width of each div is still 32 pixels, but the overall width of the container will only be as wide as the combined width of the divs.

By using inline-flex in the context of the CategoryChip component, the chips will be displayed inline with each other, creating a horizontal layout.
