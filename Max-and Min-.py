Yes, it is possible and often advisable to use both min-width and max-width together in CSS.
When used together, they establish a range of acceptable widths for an element, allowing it to be flexible within that range.

Heres an example:


.div {
  min-width: 200px;
  max-width: 500px;
}
In this example, the .div element has a min-width of 200px and a max-width of 500px. 
This means that the element will be at least 200px wide but will not exceed 500px in width.
If the content within the element is smaller than 200px, the elements width will expand to meet the minimum requirement.
If the content is larger than 500px, the elements width will be capped at the maximum limit of 500px.

Using both min-width and max-width together provides a flexible and responsive behavior to the element. 
It allows it to adapt to different content sizes and viewport widths while still maintaining some constraints within the defined range.
This is particularly useful in creating fluid and responsive layouts that can accommodate various screen sizes and content dimensions.

By combining min-width and max-width, you can establish a range within which the element can adjust its width, 
ensuring it remains visually appealing and functional across different devices and screen sizes.
