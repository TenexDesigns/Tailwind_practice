Definition and Usage
The max-width property defines the maximum width of an element.

If the content is larger than the maximum width, it will automatically change the height of the element.

If the content is smaller than the maximum width, the max-width property has no effect.

Note: This prevents the value of the width property from becoming larger than max-width. The value of the max-width property overrides the width property.






.div{
  max-width:50%;
   width:800px
}



.div{
  max-width:50%;
   width:100px
}


-------------------------------------------------------
The max-width property in CSS defines the maximum width that an element can take up. It restricts the width of an element, preventing it from exceeding the specified value.

In the provided code examples:

Example 1:

css
Copy code
.div {
  max-width: 500px;
  width: 800px;
}
In this example, the .div element has a max-width of 500px and a width of 800px. Since the width property is set to a value larger than the max-width, the max-width property takes precedence. As a result, the actual width of the element will be limited to 500px.

Example 2:

css
Copy code
.div {
  max-width: 500px;
  width: 100px;
}
In this example, the .div element has a max-width of 500px and a width of 100px. Since the width property is smaller than the max-width, it does not exceed the max-width limit. Therefore, the max-width property has no effect, and the element will have a width of 100px.

In both cases, the max-width property ensures that the element's width does not exceed the specified value. It acts as a constraint, allowing the element to resize its width as needed, as long as it stays within the defined limit. If the content within the element is larger than the max-width, the element's height will automatically adjust to accommodate the content.

Overall, the max-width property is commonly used in responsive design to control the maximum width of elements, ensuring they fit within different viewport sizes and preventing them from becoming too wide on larger screens.
