When you disable Preflight in Tailwind CSS, it means that the default styles provided by Tailwind for various HTML elements are not applied. However, there are a few elements that you might need to pay attention to when using Tailwind CSS without Preflight. Here are some common HTML elements that may be affected:

Headings (h1, h2, h3, etc.): By default, Tailwind applies margin and font-size styles to headings. When Preflight is disabled, you will need to define your own styles for headings or use utility classes like text-2xl, text-3xl, etc., to set font sizes.

Paragraphs (p): Tailwind applies margin and line-height styles to paragraphs by default. When Preflight is disabled, you may need to define your own styles for paragraphs or use utility classes like leading-normal for line height.

Lists (ul, ol, li): Tailwind applies margin and padding styles to lists and list items. Without Preflight, you will need to define your own styles for lists or use utility classes like list-none or list-disc to remove or customize the default styles.

Blockquotes (blockquote): Tailwind applies margin and border styles to blockquotes. If Preflight is disabled, you will need to define your own styles for blockquotes or use utility classes like border-l-4 to achieve a similar effect.

Tables (table, tr, th, td): Tailwind applies border and padding styles to tables and table cells. When Preflight is disabled, you may need to define your own styles or use utility classes like border and p-4 to customize the appearance of tables.

These are just a few examples of HTML elements that may require additional styling when Preflight is disabled. It's important to review the Tailwind CSS documentation for specific elements you plan to use in your project and ensure that you define appropriate styles or utilize utility classes to achieve the desired visual appearance.

Remember that disabling Preflight gives you more control over the styles applied to HTML elements, but it also means that you need to define those styles manually or use Tailwind utility classes for consistent and predictable styling.
