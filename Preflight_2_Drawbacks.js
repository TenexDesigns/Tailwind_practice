When you disable Preflight in Tailwind CSS, it means that the default styles provided by Tailwind for various HTML elements are not applied. However, there are a few elements that you might need to pay attention to when using Tailwind CSS without Preflight. Here are some common HTML elements that may be affected:

Headings (h1, h2, h3, etc.): By default, Tailwind applies margin and font-size styles to headings. When Preflight is disabled, you will need to define your own styles for headings or use utility classes like text-2xl, text-3xl, etc., to set font sizes.

Paragraphs (p): Tailwind applies margin and line-height styles to paragraphs by default. When Preflight is disabled, you may need to define your own styles for paragraphs or use utility classes like leading-normal for line height.

Lists (ul, ol, li): Tailwind applies margin and padding styles to lists and list items. Without Preflight, you will need to define your own styles for lists or use utility classes like list-none or list-disc to remove or customize the default styles.

Blockquotes (blockquote): Tailwind applies margin and border styles to blockquotes. If Preflight is disabled, you will need to define your own styles for blockquotes or use utility classes like border-l-4 to achieve a similar effect.

Tables (table, tr, th, td): Tailwind applies border and padding styles to tables and table cells. When Preflight is disabled, you may need to define your own styles or use utility classes like border and p-4 to customize the appearance of tables.

These are just a few examples of HTML elements that may require additional styling when Preflight is disabled. It's important to review the Tailwind CSS documentation for specific elements you plan to use in your project and ensure that you define appropriate styles or utilize utility classes to achieve the desired visual appearance.

Remember that disabling Preflight gives you more control over the styles applied to HTML elements, but it also means that you need to define those styles manually or use Tailwind utility classes for consistent and predictable styling.

  Preflight in Tailwind CSS is a set of base styles designed to smooth over cross-browser inconsistencies and make it easier for you to work within the constraints of your design system docs.w3cub.com. It's built on top of modern-normalize, and Tailwind automatically injects these styles when you include @tailwind base in your CSS docs.w3cub.com.

Preflight removes all the default margins, font sizes, etc., for all your elements like your headings, blockquotes, lists, and so on blog.logrocket.com. This means that everything is unstyled and you start with a blank slate, which is great if you want to design from scratch. However, this might be surprising when you first encounter it docs.w3cub.com.

If you disable Preflight, you are essentially disabling this base style reset. This could be useful if you're integrating Tailwind into an existing project that already has its own base styles, or if you'd like to provide your own base styles tailwindcss.com, docs.w3cub.com, blog.logrocket.com.

You can disable Preflight by setting preflight to false in the corePlugins section of your tailwind.config.js file:

module.exports = {
  corePlugins: {
    preflight: false,
  }
}
