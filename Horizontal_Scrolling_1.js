To use Horizontal scrolling use this 'flex overflow-x-scroll' on the parent containr and this on the child component 'flex-shrink-0 inline-flex '

like this



To understand how horizontal scrolling is enabled in the provided code, let's break down the relevant CSS classes and properties:

flex: The flex class is used to create a flex container. Flexbox is a layout model that allows flexible and responsive positioning of elements within a container.

overflow-x-scroll: The overflow-x-scroll class is applied to the parent container to enable horizontal scrolling. It sets the overflow-x property to scroll, which displays scrollbars when the content overflows horizontally.

flex-shrink-0: The flex-shrink-0 class is used to prevent the flex items from shrinking. By default, flex items can shrink to fit the container if there is limited space. In this case, flex-shrink-0 ensures that the chips maintain their original size and do not shrink when the container width is smaller.

inline-flex: The inline-flex class is used to make the flex container an inline element. This allows the container to wrap its content horizontally and enables scrolling within the parent container.

Now, let's apply this understanding to the provided code:

jsx
Copy code
const CategoryChip = ({ category }) => {
  return (
    <div className="flex-shrink-0 inline-flex items-center px-2 py-2 m-1 rounded-md bg-gray-200 text-textColor1 font-bold text-sm">
      {category}
    </div>
  );
};

export default CategoryChip;
In the CategoryChip component, the flex-shrink-0 class is used to prevent the chip from shrinking. The inline-flex class makes the chip an inline element, allowing multiple chips to be displayed in a row.

jsx
Copy code
export default function Home() {
  const categories = ['All category','Electronics', 'Clothing', 'Home Decor', 'Sports','Electronics', 'Clothing', 'Home Decor', 'Sports','Electronics', 'Clothing', 'Home Decor', 'Sports','Electronics', 'Clothing', 'Home Decor', 'Sports'];

  return (
    <div>
      <div className="flex overflow-x-scroll">
        {categories.map((category) => (
          <CategoryChip key={category} category={category} />
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
In the Home component, the overflow-x-scroll class is applied to the parent div, which creates the horizontal scrolling effect. The flex class is used to make the parent div a flex container. The chips, rendered using the CategoryChip component, are placed within this container and will flex and scroll horizontally if needed.

By combining the flex, overflow-x-scroll, flex-shrink-0, and inline-flex classes, the provided code achieves the desired horizontal scrolling effect for the chips.

Please note that in the provided code, both SearchInput and CategoryChip components are being imported and used as the same component. You may want to ensure that you are using the correct component for your use case.

export default CategoryChip;
In the CategoryChip component, the flex-shrink-0 class is used to prevent the chip from shrinking. The inline-flex class makes the chip an inline element, allowing multiple chips to be displayed in a row.

jsx

export default function Home() {
  const categories = ['All category','Electronics', 'Clothing', 'Home Decor', 'Sports','Electronics', 'Clothing', 'Home Decor', 'Sports','Electronics', 'Clothing', 'Home Decor', 'Sports','Electronics', 'Clothing', 'Home Decor', 'Sports'];

          <CategoryChip key={category} category={category} />

}
In the Home component, the overflow-x-scroll class is applied to the parent div, which creates the horizontal scrolling effect. The flex class is used to make the parent div a flex container. The chips, rendered using the CategoryChip component, are placed within this container and will flex and scroll horizontally if needed.
